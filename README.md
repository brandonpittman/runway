# Runway

**A starter theme for Statamic with Laravel Mix and Tailwind CSS**

*â€¦and because Freebird didn't set up PurgeCSS correctly*

Runway is a theme boilerplate with Tailwind 1.0, Laravel Mix, and ready to go with dynamic Vue components.


## Setup

1. Get a statamic site up and running with your preferred method
2. Download Freebird into your `site/themes` folder
   - or clone from github with `git clone https://github.com/brandonpittman/runway.git`
3. Set Runway to the active theme under **Settings => Theming** in the control panel,
   or in the `site/settings/theming.yaml` file.
4. Install dependencies with `npm install` and build assets with `npm run dev`
5. Check out your site! Feel free to delete `{layouts,templates}/default.html`.

## Building Your Theme

**The theme assets are all within the `resources` folder.**
